## Overview

area b15 is the classic Fifteen puzzle game with a few bells and whistles:

  1. Each puzzle is made up of a photo that changes daily
  1. Everything is rendered in 3D including a sky that adjusts based on the local time and some fanfare if you win
  
## Credits

I used [smartcrop.js](https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js/) to automatically crop portrait and landscape photos to a square and I used [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering basically everything. The puzzle is hosted on github pages and can be accessed [here](https://brianchoi.net/b15/).
